# pynexa
The nexa module in Python.

This is a module that recreates the Nexa data processing pipeline in Python (from its original C++)


There are two important classes one that wraps the data in a specific format and
another class that knows how to process that specfici format.

In the file `mnist_demo.py` an example on how to run the pipeline can be found.
